    <h1>Why This is Important</h1>
    <p> This website was made because we really do care about you. We want everyone 
to have a second chance. Itʼs not too late to change. We can all do better, and that 
starts with taking action. If you are viewing this website, but donʼt have a problem, 
then you might have friends who do.</p>
    <h1>Help Your Freinds Detox</h1>
    <p> Share this information with your friends, and family. We need to spread the word 
so that we can help as many people as possible. There are people who have dug 
themselves into this pineapple addiction, and it can be very hard to get out.</p>
    <h1>The Detoxing Process</h1>
    <p> Detoxing is not easy. While you are detoxing, your brain will get thoughts about 
eating pineapple and want to go back. Donʼt listen to those thoughts, going back 
isnʼt worth it in the end. Do you really want those sins to lay upon you when you 
are at the judgment seat with Jesus Christ?</p>
    <h1>Repent</h1>
    <p>We can all repent, but it can be process that could take a while. For others it may 
be easy, but for some, it can be really challenging. Jesus died so that we could 
repent of our sins through his atonement. Turn away from eating pineapple in your 
sick ways, and turn to God. You donʼt have to go through this alone.</p>
